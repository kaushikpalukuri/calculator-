Basic Structure and Layout:
Create a simple HTML file that includes a calculator interface with buttons for digits (0-9), basic operators (+, -, *, /), and a clear button. Use a <div> or <input> element to display the calculation result.

Styling with CSS:
Use CSS to style the calculator for better user experience. Add padding, margins, and grid-based layouts to arrange buttons neatly. Include hover effects and a clear, readable display area.

Interactivity with JavaScript:
Implement JavaScript to handle button clicks. Include logic to append numbers and operators to the display, evaluate the expression when "=" is pressed, and reset the display when "C" is clicked. Use eval() for simple expressions (with caution) or a safer parsing method.
